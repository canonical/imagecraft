# Security policy

The following documents the imagecraft security policy.

## Supported Versions

Imagecraft is not ready for producation use, so no stable version is available yet.

Once imagecraft is published, we plan on supporting the last version published in the `latest/stable` channel of the [Snapstore](https://snapcraft.io/imagecraft).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security issue, please email [security@ubuntu.com](mailto:security@ubuntu.com) with a description of the issue, the steps you took to create the issue, affected versions, and, if known, mitigations for the issue.

The [Ubuntu Security disclosure and embargo policy](https://ubuntu.com/security/disclosure-policy) contains more information about what you can expect when you contact us and what we expect from you.
