# Imagecraft

The base repository for Imagecraft projects.

## Description

Imagecraft is a craft tool used to create Ubuntu bootable images. It
follows the same principles as Snapcraft, but is focused on creating
bootable images instead.

## Documentation

Imagecraft documentation is built from reStructuredText (`.rst`) files,
most of them under the `docs/` folder in the source tree. [Build and
browse the documentation
locally](#build-and-browse-the-documentation-locally) if you prefer,
although the [product
website](https://canonical-imagecraft.readthedocs-hosted.com) is
recommended.

### Build and browse the documentation locally

Clone the official source tree from GitHub into your computer\'s home
directory. Its default location will then be `~/imagecraft/`. (You may
clone the [Imagecraft
repository](https://github.com/canonical/imagecraft) directly. However,
it\'s protected: if you plan on [contributing to the
project](#project-and-community), consider forking it to your own GitHub
account then cloning that instead.)

Install the documentation tools:

```bash
make setup-docs
```

Build and serve the documentation:

```bash
make docs-auto
```

Point your web browser to address `127.0.0.1:8080`.

## Community and support

You can report any issues or bugs on the project's [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/canonical/imagecraft/issues).

Imagecraft is covered by the [Ubuntu Code of
Conduct](https://ubuntu.com/community/ethos/code-of-conduct).

Imagecraft is open source and part of the Canonical family. We would love your help.
